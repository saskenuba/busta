This is mainly a test for learning the Rust language, which seems to be awesome with its memory management tools. And it is cool to step out dynamicaly typed languages for a bit.

The original **"Ray Tracing in One Weekend"** is written in C++, so it is very practical to use it to learn a new language. The e-book is open sourced and you can find it here: http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf
